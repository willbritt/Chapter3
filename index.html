  <h1> Chapter 3 Essay </h1>
  <body>
    <p> Chapter 3 in Cairo's book is all about the message that a visualization
      presents to its audience and the how close that message is to the absolute
      truth. According to Cairo, designers should focus on creating models that
      are not needlessly complex and that are hard to misinterpret by the viewer.
      All included information should be necessary for the message, and it should
      not be oversimplified. This allows the subject being conveyed to be more
      clarified and less likely to be misinterpeted. Cairo also mentions common
      traits/patterns that humans have that lead to mistakes by designers.
      These traits include: the patternicity bug, the storytelling bug, and the
      confirmation. Each one of these ideas can lead to incorrect judgements
      about different ideology and phenomenon. A designer's ability to overcome
      these tricks played by the mind can improve their chances of creating
      a visual, that is not necessarily perfect by any measure, but good enough
      to deliver an  accuarte and meaningful messgae.

    <p> Thinking of a situation in which a lied allowed someone to tell the truth
       better was a tough question, but one situation in particular did come to
       mind. I am referring to instances of clickbait on  the internet. Like
       Cairo referenced, intriguing headlines can really attract interest from
       readers. In the situation that I am referring to in particular, false
       headlines could be used positively if they were apart of links to
       important truthful information such as our current enviornmntal crisis.
       Using clickbait to more or less trick individuals into reading valueable
       information could be an interesting strategy choice by people trying to
       get valueable information out to the world.
